# Kontena Pharos CLI Tools Reference

Users manage Kontena Pharos clusters with `pharos` CLI tool. The `pharos` tool takes care of installing and upgrading their clusters to different versions of Kubernetes and their dependencies (like networking, kubelet, kube-proxy, cri-o etc) to versions that are compatible with that Kubernetes version.

With `chpharos` it's easy to install multiple versions of `pharos` binaries with the corresponding versions of management tools such as `kubectl` and switch between them while managing your clusters.
